Verdict:
A clear year-over-year pattern in monthly sales cannot be reliably identified because the dataset lacks full-year data for either 2022 or 2023. Most months have data for only one of the two years, making it difficult to assess whether specific months (e.g., December) consistently exhibit higher sales. For instance, while December 2022 shows strong performance, there‚Äôs no corresponding data for December 2023 to compare. Therefore, more complete, multi-year data is needed to identify recurring sales trends across the same months.
