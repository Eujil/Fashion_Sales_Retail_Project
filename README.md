# Fashion_Sales_Retail_Project

**Dataset:**
The dataset is the retail sales of fashion items consisting columns such as Customer Reference ID,Item Purchased,Purchase Amount (USD),Date Purchase,Review Rating,Payment Method. 

The dataset lacks the ff:
- Only offers two incomplete year worth of data
- No Units Sold or Quantity Sold per item
- No geographical data
- No Customer Demographics
- No indication for discounts

I will be answering four questions which are: 
- Which months have the highest and lowest sales overall?
- Is there a recurring pattern in sales over the years during the same months (e.g., is December always high)?
- How do monthly sales trends differ by product category (e.g., tops, pants, accessories)?
- Which fashion items perform best during specific seasons?

**Tools Used:**
- PostgreSQL
- SQL
- Visual Studio Code 
- Git & Github
- Tableau
